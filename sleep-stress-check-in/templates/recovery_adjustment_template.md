# Recovery-Based Program Adjustment

## Status Update
"I can see your [sleep/stress] has been rough this week. That's going to affect your recovery, so let's adjust your program temporarily to keep you moving forward without burning out."

## Temporary Adjustments
- **Intensity:** Drop RPE targets by 1 (e.g., RPE 8 -> RPE 7).
- **Volume:** [No change / Reduced by 20-30% (accessory work removed)].
- **Nutrition:** [No change / Moved to Maintenance].

## Sleep Hygiene Recommendations
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent bed and wake time.
- **Environment:** Keep your room cool and dark.
- **Routine:** No screens 30 minutes before bed.
- **Caffeine:** Limit caffeine intake after the early afternoon.

## Reversion Criteria
We will return to your normal programming once your [sleep/stress] has normalized for **3 consecutive days**.
