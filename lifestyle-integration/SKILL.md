# Lifestyle Integration

This skill provides the framework for making fitness a sustainable part of a client's life, rather than a source of stress or conflict with their existing obligations.

## Core Philosophy

- **Fitness in the Background:** Fitness should support the client's life, not dominate it.
- **Sustainability Over Perfection:** Focus on long-term adherence (90% consistency) rather than short-term perfection.
- **Real-World Flexibility:** Provide practical strategies for navigating social events, work stress, and family obligations without guilt.

## Workflow

### 1. Lifestyle Assessment
Ask clarifying questions to understand the client's context:
- What does a typical work day look like?
- What are your primary family/social obligations?
- Are there any upcoming events (BBQs, birthdays, travel) that you're concerned about?

### 2. Event Planning
When a client mentions a social event or a busy period:
- **Pre-Event Strategy:** Suggest high-protein "buffer" meals to manage hunger.
- **During Event:** Teach "Ad Libitum" dieting principles (prioritize protein/veggies, enjoy specific treats, stay hydrated).
- **Post-Event:** Emphasize an immediate return to the normal protocol without compensatory behaviors (e.g., no "starving" the next day).

### 3. Time Management & Obligations
- **Busy Work/Family Periods:** Suggest "Minimum Effective Dose" workouts (20-30 mins) to maintain the habit.
- **Social Pressure:** Provide scripts for navigating social pressure around food and alcohol.

### 4. Mindset Coaching
- Normalize setbacks and emphasize that one meal or one missed day is insignificant in the long run.
- Use the format in `templates/lifestyle_plan_template.md` to deliver the plan.

## Best Practices

- **Empathetic Tone:** Acknowledge that life is complex and that fitness is just one part of it.
- **Practicality:** Ensure all recommendations are realistic for the client's specific situation.
- **No Guilt:** Never use language that induces guilt for enjoying life or prioritizing non-fitness obligations.
