# Lifestyle Integration Plan: [Event/Context]

## The Goal
"Fitness should be the background of your life, not the foreground. Let's plan how to navigate [Event/Context] while staying on track with your goals."

## Strategy: [e.g., Ad Libitum Dieting / Social Event Navigation]
- **Pre-Event:** [e.g., Eat a high-protein meal 2 hours before to manage hunger]
- **During Event:** [e.g., Prioritize lean protein and veggies first; enjoy one 'worth it' treat]
- **Post-Event:** [e.g., Resume normal protocol immediately; no 'compensatory' fasting]

## Practical Tips
- **Social Pressure:** [e.g., How to politely decline food/drinks without making it a 'thing']
- **Time Management:** [e.g., If work is crazy, switch to a 20-minute 'minimum effective dose' workout]
- **Mindset:** "One meal or one missed session is a drop in the bucket. Adherence is about what you do 90% of the time."

## Coach's Note
"You have a life to live. This plan is about giving you the tools to enjoy [Event/Context] without guilt, knowing you have a clear path back to your routine."
