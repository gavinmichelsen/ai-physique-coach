# Motivation & Accountability

This skill provides a structured approach to maintaining client engagement, handling setbacks, and providing the right level of support during motivational dips.

## Workflow

### 1. Proactive Outreach
Monitor the `excel-tracker` and `daily-check-in` logs. If a client stops providing data:
- **2 Days:** Send a casual nudge.
- **3+ Days:** Send a direct check-in offering support without judgment.
- **1 Week:** Send a "door is always open" message to reduce the friction of returning.

### 2. Handling Frustration
When a client expresses a lack of results:
- **Pull Data:** Use objective metrics (strength, weight trends, measurements) to show progress they may be overlooking.
- **Validate:** Acknowledge their feelings while grounding the conversation in data.
- **Update if Necessary:** If the data truly shows a stall, trigger the `program-update` skill.

### 3. Managing Overwhelm
If a client is struggling with adherence:
- **Simplify:** Strip the program back to the "Big Three" (Protein, Steps, Gym Frequency).
- **Normalize:** Reassure them that perfection isn't required for progress.

## Best Practices

- **Real Tone:** Avoid generic motivational quotes. Be the coach who is honest, direct, and genuinely invested.
- **No Judgment:** Always maintain a supportive environment. The goal is to get the client back on track, not to make them feel guilty.
- **Action-Oriented:** When a client is unmotivated, give them a small, manageable task (e.g., "Just do the first two exercises").
