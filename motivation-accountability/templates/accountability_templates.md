# Motivation & Accountability Templates

## Proactive Outreach (The "Dark" Client)
- **2 Days No Contact:** "Hey [Name], haven't heard from you in a couple days — everything good?"
- **3+ Days No Contact:** "Just checking in, [Name]. No judgment if life got busy. Want to get back on track today or do you need to talk about what's going on?"
- **1 Week No Contact:** "I'm here whenever you're ready, [Name]. The program doesn't expire. Just say the word and we pick up right where we left off."

## Handling Setbacks
- **"I fell off this weekend":** "One weekend doesn't undo weeks of work. Consistency over perfection — let's just get back to the plan today."
- **"I'm overwhelmed":** "Let's strip it back. This week, just focus on: hit protein, get your steps, and make it to the gym 3 times. That's it. We'll build back from there."

## Motivational Challenges
- **"I'm not seeing results":** [Pull data from tracker] "I hear you, but let's look at the data. Your strength is up on [Exercise], and your weight is trending down by [X] lbs/week. You're making progress even if it feels slow!"
- **"I don't feel like training today":** "Show up and do the first two exercises. If you still want to leave after that, leave. Most of the time you won't."
