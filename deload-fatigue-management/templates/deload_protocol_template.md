# Reactive Deload Protocol: [Week Dates]

## Why We Are Deloading
[e.g., Lifts stalled for 2 weeks / Client reported excessive fatigue / Joint pain]

## The Protocol
- **Duration:** 1 Week
- **Volume Adjustment:** Reduce sets by 40-50% (e.g., if you usually do 4 sets, do 2).
- **Intensity Adjustment:** **Maintain Intensity.** Use the same weights and RPE targets as your last successful session.
- **Exercises:** Keep the same exercises as your current program.

## Training Schedule
| Day | Session | Volume Change | Intensity Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Day 1] | [Session Name] | [X] sets per exercise | Keep weight same as last week |
| [Day 2] | [Session Name] | [X] sets per exercise | Keep weight same as last week |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Coach's Note
This is not an "easy week" with light weights. We are maintaining the stimulus while cutting the volume to let your body recover. Expect performance to rebound in 1-2 weeks after this deload.
