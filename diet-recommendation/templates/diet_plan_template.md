## Daily & Weekly Targets

| Metric | Daily Target | Weekly Target | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calories** | **[Number] kcal** | **[Number] kcal** | [e.g., 15% deficit from TDEE of X kcal] |
| **Protein** | [Number] g | [Number] g | [e.g., 0.82g per lb of goal bodyweight of X lbs] |
| **Fat** | [Number] g | [Number] g | [e.g., 0.35g per lb of current bodyweight; min 20% of cals] |
| **Carbs** | [Number] g | [Number] g | Remaining calories after protein and fat |
| **Fiber** | [Number] g | — | Aim for 10-15g per 1,000 kcal consumed |

## Macro Cycling (Optional)

If applicable, use this section to provide differentiated targets for training and rest days. Weekly calorie and protein totals must remain the same.

| Metric | Training Day | Rest Day |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calories** | [Number] kcal | [Number] kcal |
| **Protein** | [Number] g | [Number] g |
| **Fat** | [Number] g | [Number] g |
| **Carbs** | [Number] g | [Number] g |

## Key Lifestyle & Nutrition Guidelines

| Category | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hydration** | Drink to thirst. Monitor urine color—aim for pale yellow. Make water easily accessible throughout the day. |
| **Food Quality** | Prioritize whole, minimally processed foods. Build your diet around non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, fruits, nuts, seeds, and healthy fats. Aim for ~800g of combined fruits and vegetables per day. |
| **Meal Timing** | Total daily intake is the priority. Eat on a consistent schedule that works for your lifestyle. |
| **Alcohol** | Limit consumption, especially during fat loss. Alcohol hinders recovery, impairs sleep, and provides empty calories. Abstinence is optimal for physique goals. |
| **Supplements** | If you do not consume fatty fish 2-3 times per week, supplement with omega-3 (EPA/DHA). Consider a general multivitamin as insurance if diet variety is limited. |

## Food Quality Tiers

Use this hierarchy to guide food choices for optimal health and performance.

| Tier | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1: Healthy Staples** | Non-starchy vegetables, seafood, berries, avocados, olives, nuts, seeds, legumes, herbs & spices |
| **Tier 2: Healthy Additions** | Whole fruits, poultry, fermented dairy (kefir, yogurt), tubers/potatoes, whole grains, dark chocolate (>80% cacao) |
| **Tier 3: Balanced Diet** | Non-fermented dairy, eggs (preferably omega-3), soy products |
| **Tier 4: Neutral** | Artificial sweeteners, zero-calorie sodas |
| **Tier 5: Limit** | Sugars & syrups, refined grains, processed meats |
| **Tier 6: Avoid** | Anything with trans fats or partially hydrogenated oils, alcohol, tobacco |

## Strategic Adjustments

| Strategy | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Diet Breaks** | After 8+ weeks of continuous dieting, we can plan a 1-2 week break at maintenance calories (increase via carbs) to support adherence and hormonal function. |
| **Refeeds** | 1-2 day periods of increased carbohydrate intake at or slightly above maintenance. Used to restore glycogen, boost performance, and provide a psychological break. |
| **Adjustment Triggers** | If progress stalls for 2-4 consecutive weeks (no change in weekly average weight or measurements), we will make a small caloric adjustment of 100-200 kcal. If weight loss exceeds 1.5% of bodyweight per week, the deficit may be too aggressive. |

## Energy Balance Verification

If two reliable body composition measurements are available (e.g., DEXA scans), we can verify your actual energy balance using the following formula:

> **Energy Balance = (Change in LBM in kg × 1816) + (Change in Fat Mass in kg × 9441)**

| Measurement | Date 1: [Date] | Date 2: [Date] | Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lean Body Mass** | [Number] kg | [Number] kg | [+/- Number] kg |
| **Fat Mass** | [Number] kg | [Number] kg | [+/- Number] kg |
| **Calculated Energy Balance** | — | — | **[Number] kcal** |
| **Interpretation** | — | — | [Deficit / Surplus / Maintenance] |

This helps us compare your tracked intake against your actual body composition changes and troubleshoot any discrepancies.

## Onboarding Notes
- **Week 1-2 Focus:** Prioritize hitting your calorie and protein targets. Do not stress about precise fat and carb splits yet.
- **Tracking Strategy:** Log meals by sending a photo or text description to your coach (e.g., "I just had a Fairlife protein shake" or snap a photo of your plate). The AI tracks your daily calories and macros — no external apps needed. Weigh yourself daily in the morning and report the weekly average.
