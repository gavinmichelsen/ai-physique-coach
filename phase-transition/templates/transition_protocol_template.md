## What to Expect (The "Scale Bump")
"You'll probably see the scale bump up 2-4 lbs in the first week or two. That's water and glycogen refilling your muscles, not fat. It's a good thing—your muscles will look fuller and your energy will improve."

## Coach's Note
"We are moving directly to your new maintenance calories. No reverse dieting is needed. This period allows your body and mind to recover before we start the next phase."
