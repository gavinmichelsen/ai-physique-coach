# Cardio Programming

This skill provides the logic and structure for managing cardiovascular activity as part of a physique transformation protocol.

## Philosophy

### 1. Steps as the Primary Tool
- **Sustainability:** Steps are more sustainable and trackable than structured cardio.
- **Recovery:** Steps have minimal interference with resistance training recovery.
- **Target Hierarchy:** Always prioritize step targets over adding structured cardio.

### 2. Step Targets by Goal
- **Fat Loss:** 10,000-12,000 daily (minimum 7,500).
- **Maintenance:** 8,000-10,000 daily.
- **Lean Bulk:** 7,500-10,000 daily.
- **Ramp-up:** If a client currently averages under 5,000 steps, increase by 2,000-2,500 per week until the target is reached.

### 3. Structured Cardio (Optional)
- **LISS (Low-Intensity Steady State):** 2-3 sessions/week of 20-30 minutes (walking, cycling, swimming). Add only if step targets are insufficient or the client enjoys it.
- **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training):** Never prescribe as default. Limit to 1-2 sessions/week if requested. **Never** schedule on or before heavy leg days due to recovery demands.

## Adjustment Hierarchy for Fat Loss

When fat loss stalls, follow this order of adjustments:
1.  **Increase Steps:** Add 1,000 steps to the daily target.
2.  **Add LISS:** Introduce or increase LISS sessions.
3.  **Reduce Calories:** Only consider reducing intake after increasing expenditure.

## Workflow

1.  **Pull Profile:** Review the client's current goal and average daily steps.
2.  **Set Step Target:** Determine the appropriate target based on the goal and current activity level.
3.  **Determine Structured Cardio:** Decide if LISS or HIIT is necessary based on the client's preferences and progress.
4.  **Define Ramp-up:** If the current average is low, create a weekly ramp-up plan.
5.  **Present Plan:** Use the format in `templates/cardio_plan_template.md`.
6.  **Explain "Why":** Reiterate that steps are the primary tool for sustainable fat loss and recovery.
