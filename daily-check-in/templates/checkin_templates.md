# Daily Check-In Templates

## Morning Check-In
*Trigger: Client's wake time*
"Good morning! Quick check-in: 
1) How'd you sleep? (1-10) 
2) How many hours of sleep? 
3) What's your weight this morning?"

## Evening Check-In
*Trigger: 1 hour before client's bedtime*
"End of day check-in: 
1) How many steps today? 
2) Roughly how many calories and grams of protein today? 
3) Stress level today? (1-10) 
4) Any notes — travel, illness, missed meals, anything off?"

## Training Session Follow-up
*Trigger: Client reports completing a session*
"How did [Session Name] go? Give me the exercises with weights, reps, and how hard they felt (RPE)."

## Nudge Message
*Trigger: No response to morning check-in after 2 hours*
"Hey [Name], just a quick nudge for your morning stats when you have a second! No rush."

## Positive Reinforcement
*Trigger: Consistent adherence (e.g., 7 days straight)*
"That's 7 days straight of hitting your protein target — solid consistency, [Name]! Keep it up."
