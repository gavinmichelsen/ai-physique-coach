# Progress Photos

This skill provides a structured workflow for collecting, comparing, and providing feedback on client progress photos to track visual physique changes.

## Workflow

### 1. Request Photos
- **Cadence:** Request photos every 2-4 weeks, typically aligned with measurement days.
- **Instructions:** Provide clear instructions for consistency:
    - **Lighting:** Same lighting for every set.
    - **Location:** Same location/background.
    - **Time:** Morning, fasted, after using the bathroom.
    - **Angles:** Front relaxed, side relaxed, back relaxed. (Optional: front flexed, most muscular).

### 2. Store and Tag
- Store the photos and tag them with the date and client ID.
- Maintain a historical record for long-term comparison.

### 3. Comparison and Feedback
- When new photos arrive, pull the previous set for a side-by-side comparison.
- **Specific Observations:** Provide honest, encouraging feedback on visible changes. Be specific (e.g., "Your waist is visibly tighter" or "Shoulders are filling out").
- **No Visible Change:** If changes aren't obvious, reassure the client that 2-4 weeks is a short window. Point to other metrics like strength gains, weight trends, or measurements.

### 4. Present Feedback
- Use the format in `templates/photo_comparison_template.md` to deliver the assessment.

## Best Practices

- **Consistency is Key:** Emphasize that consistent photos are necessary for accurate assessment.
- **Honesty and Encouragement:** Be truthful about what you see while remaining supportive and positive.
- **Contextualize:** Always link visual changes back to the client's specific physique priorities (e.g., "We're seeing that shoulder width we talked about").
