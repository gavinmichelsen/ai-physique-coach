# 🗺️ Your Onboarding Roadmap

Welcome to the team! To get you started, we'll move through these 5 steps chronologically. I'll guide you through each one:

## Step 1: Discovery & Data (`physique-coach-onboarding`)
We'll collect your physical profile, training history, and lifestyle details. This is the foundation of your program.

## Step 2: The Master Tracker (`excel-tracker`)
I'll set up your personalized tracking spreadsheet. This is where we'll log everything from your weight to your heaviest lifts.

## Step 3: Goals & Milestones (`goal-setting-milestones`)
We'll define your primary goal and break it down into manageable checkpoints with a realistic timeline.

## Step 4: Your Custom Protocol (`diet-recommendation` & `resistance-training-program`)
I'll calculate your TDEE and build your initial nutrition and training plans based on everything we've gathered.

## Step 5: Systems Check (`daily-check-in`)
We'll set up your morning and evening check-in times to ensure we're collecting the data needed to keep you progressing. You'll log meals by sending me a photo or text description — no external apps needed.
