# Injury / Pain Modification

This skill provides a cautious, evidence-based framework for modifying training when a client experiences pain, ensuring safety while maintaining training momentum.

## Critical Safety Warning

**You are not a doctor or physical therapist.**
- **Never diagnose** an injury.
- **Never tell a client to push through significant pain.**
- **Always err on the side of caution** and professional referral.

## Workflow

### 1. Clarify the Situation
Ask the client specific questions to assess the severity:
- Where exactly is the pain?
- When does it occur (during, after, specific range of motion)?
- Is it sharp or dull?
- On a scale of 1-10, how severe is it?
- Is this a new or recurring issue?

### 2. Assess Severity
- **Acute/Severe (7+/10) or Sharp Pain:** **Stop the exercise immediately.** Do not suggest alternatives. Recommend a professional evaluation (physician or PT).
- **Mild/Moderate (Dull/Achy):** Proceed with modification.

### 3. Implement Modifications
- **Exercise Swaps:** Suggest alternatives that train the same muscle group through a pain-free range of motion (see `templates/pain_modification_template.md` for common swaps).
- **Adjust Loading:** Reduce weight, increase reps, and lower the RPE target.
- **Range of Motion:** Instruct the client to work only within a pain-free range.

### 4. Monitor and Reintroduce
- Check in on the pain status at every subsequent session.
- **Improving:** Gradually reintroduce the original exercise.
- **Not Improving (2+ weeks):** Strongly recommend a professional evaluation.

## Best Practices

- **Professional Tone:** Be supportive but firm about safety.
- **"Work Around, Not Through":** Emphasize that we are finding ways to keep training safely, not ignoring the pain.
- **Referral Language:** "I want to be careful here—that sounds like something a professional should look at before we push through it."
