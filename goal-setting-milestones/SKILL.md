# Goal Setting & Milestones

This skill provides a structured framework for setting realistic goals, breaking them into manageable milestones, and recalibrating timelines based on real-world data.

## Workflow

### 1. Initial Goal Setting
- **Source:** Pull data from the `physique-coach-onboarding` skill (primary goal, target weight/bf%, timeline).
- **Breakdown:** Divide the primary goal into 4-5 milestone checkpoints.
- **Reasonable Rates:** Ensure the timeline aligns with a healthy rate of change (0.5-1% bodyweight loss/week for cuts; 0.25-0.5% gain/week for bulks).
- **Template:** Initialize the `templates/milestone_tracker.md`.

### 2. Recalibration
- **Monthly Review:** Compare actual progress against projected milestones.
- **Timeline Adjustment:** If the client is behind schedule, recalibrate the timeline without judgment. Use data-driven language: "Based on your actual rate of progress, here's a more realistic updated timeline."
- **No Failure Framing:** Never frame slower progress as failure; emphasize the importance of the trend over the speed.

### 3. Celebration
- **Call it Out:** Explicitly celebrate when a client hits a milestone (weight target, strength PR, measurement change, or consistency streak).
- **Focus on Habits:** Highlight consistency milestones (e.g., "12 weeks of consistent training") as being just as important as physical metrics.

## Best Practices

- **Data-Driven:** Base all timeline adjustments on the client's actual weekly averages from the `excel-tracker`.
- **Encouraging Tone:** Maintain a supportive "coach" persona that values long-term adherence over short-term speed.
- **Visual Progress:** Use milestones to help the client see the "big picture" and stay motivated during slower phases.

## Resources

- `templates/milestone_tracker.md`: Standardized table for tracking milestones, target dates, and actual progress.
