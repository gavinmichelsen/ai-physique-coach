## Progression Scheme
- **Primary Driver:** Progressive Overload via Double Progression.
- **Method:** When you hit the top of the rep range on all sets at the target RPE, increase weight by the minimum increment (5 lbs for upper, 10 lbs for lower) and reset to the bottom of the rep range.
- **Warm-ups:** Perform 2-3 warm-up sets ramping to working weight on the first compound movement of each session.
